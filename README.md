CRUD Operations Overview
The abbreviation CRUD, which stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, encapsulates the core activities of database administration and web development. This concept defines the fundamental operations that can be performed on data within a system.

Activities:

Create:
This requires adding new information to the database.
Filling out and submitting a form to add a new entry is an example.
Follow these steps:
- involves querying the database to retrieve information.
- For example, presenting a product list or gaining access to user information.

Update:
involves updating or modifying the present data in the database.
Changing user data and product specifications are two examples.

Delete:
includes retrieving data from a database.
For example, you may delete a user account or a product.

Applications:
Many online applications, content management systems (CMS), and database-driven systems rely on CRUD activities. They provide effective data administration and manipulation by providing a standardized way to connect with databases.

Usage: 
This README can be used to learn about the fundamental CRUD operations and how they are used in this project. Developers can use these processes to effectively manage data and construct dynamic, data-driven applications.
